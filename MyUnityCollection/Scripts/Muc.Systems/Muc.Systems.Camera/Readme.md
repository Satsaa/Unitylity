# Camera

## Purpose

This is a basic Camera system for quickly setting up a usable Camera, useful for testing purposes but sufficient for simple games.

## MyUnityCamera

This Component contains all parameters for the Camera, and controls smoothing and positioning based on those values.

Other Components can then modify those parameters to add features like zooming, rotation, dragging etc.
